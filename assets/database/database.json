The data indicates that it matches the description in the submission for the original entry. The sequence identified by them was 192 bp and 64 aa. A cDNA clone of 396 bp representing 131 aa with 64 of the first 66 aa identical to the Eriksson sequence was identified by Tan and Chew and the protein sequence entered in NCBI as ABL09307 in 2006. should be added. It is \"\"unusual\"\" that the Eriksson manuscript did not show the cDNA as they report a full length aa sequence.
